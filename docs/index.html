								I am currently a Clinical Informatics research assistant at UTSouthwestern,

						One of the projects I was working on at the time ended up being inturrupted
						by the 2019 Novel Coronavirus pandemic. Frustrated by the fact that the pandemic
						was claiming lives while I sat at home, I educated myself on common models of
						disease spread and proposed an adaptation of Kermack and McKendrick's SIR model
						for my Master's thesis. <a href="https://profiles.utsouthwestern.edu/profile/184918/richard-medford.html">Dr. Richard Medford</a> graciously served as a committee
						member for that project, and I began working with him and the rest of the folks at 
						UTSouthwestern's
						<a href="https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/departments/clinical-informatics/about/">
						Clinical Informatics Center</a> shortly thereafter.

						I am also proudly Texan (born n' raised), biracial, bisexual, and nonbinary. Please
						feel free to refer to me with any pronouns you like.
