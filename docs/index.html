								I am currently a second-year Ph.D student in Computer Science at the University of Chicago.
								I am a member of <a href="https://super.cs.uchicago.edu/">UChicago's SUPERGroup</a>,
								led by <a href="https://www.blaseur.com/">Dr. Blase Ur</a>. 
								Most of my work right now involves working with large transformer-based language models like those in the GPT family,
								of which ChatGPT is probably the most famous. I am particularly interested in what it means for a large language model to have a "bug", 
								as well as topics surrounding transformer's security applications.

						My research interests generally lie at the union of security, machine learning, and HCI. I also like parallelism and 
						distributed systems, which I pursued more directly while I was a student at UT Dallas. <br> <br>
						I worked predominantly with

						<a href="https://profiles.utsouthwestern.edu/profile/188549/christoph-lehmann.html">Dr. Christoph Lehmann</a>, and

						of UTSouthwestern's <a href="https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/departments/clinical-informatics/about/">
						Clinical Informatics Center</a> prior to starting my Ph.D. My work while at UTSouthwestern ultimately culminated in appointments as 
						Trainee Member and POI of the center.
						<br/> <br/>
						I enjoy <a href="teaching.html">teaching</a> in positions that require me to work directly with students, and do so at least once a year.
						If I am your TA for a class, please don't tweet at me. But, do come to office hours.
						<br/> <br/>
						I am also proudly Texan (born n' raised), biracial, bisexual, and nonbinary. Please
						feel free to refer to me with any pronouns you like.
