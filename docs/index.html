								I am currently a fifth-year Ph.D student in Computer Science at the University of Chicago.
								I am a member of <a href="https://super.cs.uchicago.edu/">UChicago's SUPERGroup</a>,
								where I am advised by <a href="https://www.blaseur.com/">Dr. Blase Ur</a>. 
								My research involves working with Large Language Models (LLMs) in a privacy and security context. I am interested in using LLMs as tools to preserve end-user privacy and security,
								as well as developing principled approaches for making LLMs safer tools to use in other contexts.
