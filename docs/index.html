									I am a fifth-year Computer Science PhD student at the University of Chicago.
									I am advised by <a href="https://www.blaseur.com/">Blase Ur</a> and am a member of <a href="https://super.cs.uchicago.edu/">UChicago's SUPERGroup</a>. 
									My research investigates how, if, or when LLMs can be used as an interface for meeting end-user privacy and security needs.
									I have explored how LLMs may exhibit undesirable behavior when <a href="projects.html#LLM-values">completing everyday, agentic tasks</a> like booking a flight; 
									how they might be used to <a href="projects.html#LLM-passwords">determine if a user's password is weak</a> so a user can change it; and for facilitating <a href="projects.html#LLM-policies">normative privacy policy annotation</a> so that end-users can intuitively understand a privacy policy's impact.
									<br/>
									<br/>
									I am also proudly Texan (born n' raised), biracial, bisexual, and nonbinary (they/them). 
									I powerlift, play music, and enjoy very nerdy tabletop games in my free time.
