							I was responsible for leading one of four programming projects for <a href=https://sites.google.com/site/cs154uchicago/2022-spr?authuser=0>
							UChicago's Introduction to Computer Systems Course </a> in Spring of 2022. 
							</br></br>Some students left me some lovely feedback in an anonymous survey, post-project: </br> </br> 
							<ul>
								<li>
									"I've never had a better TA than Madison (I'm a third year student). They are so caring and generous with their time. More than that, they are an extremely clear and effective teacher, always armed with multiple answers to ensure their students fully understand the concept at hand. They made an impossible project feel attainable to me and substantially contributed to my understanding the concepts at the heart of the class." 
								</li>
								<li class="mt-1">
									"I thought your greatest strength was not being satisfied until the student understood what was being explained to the maximum degree. Your passion for teaching and CS was obvious in your office hours and made me feel comfortable asking questions and motivated to work. I especially appreciated how you worked beyond your designated hours in order to ensure your students understood everything - it really demonstrated how passionate you are for the field and teaching others." </br>
								</li>
								<li  class="mt-1">
									"I really think you do a great job explaining things without just giving up the answer. I find this method of answering questions very very helpful, because it really helps me understand the concepts first, and then be able to answer the question as a result of that. I always felt like I learned something in office hours."
