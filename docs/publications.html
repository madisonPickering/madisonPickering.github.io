								[2021] NetworkSIR and EnvironmentalSIR: Effective, Open-Source Epidemic Modeling in the Absence of Data
							</p>
							<i><b>Madison Pickering</b>, Subbarayan Venkatesan, Christoph Lehmann, Sameh Saleh, Richard Medford</i>.
							<a href="publications_pdfs/AMIA_NetworkSIR.pdf">[Link]</a>
							<br> <br>
							This paper is essentially a summary of my Master's thesis. It was accepted to AMIA 2021's Annual Symposium,
							where it placed second in the Best Student Paper completition! (Prize: 350$; Rank: 2/55 submitted papers (Top 3.6%)) Since it 
							was written with a primarily medical audience in mind it has none of the discussion regarding
							efficency that the thesis does.
							The above link is the manuscript that I submitted to AMIA. You can also find it on <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8861737/"> PubMed</a>,
							which has destroyed the formatting for some of the equations.

								[2020] NetworkSIR And EnvironmentalSIR: Two Simple Distributed Mechanisms For Modeling Epidemics
							</p>
							<i><b>Madison Pickering</b></i>.
							<a href="https://www.proquest.com/docview/2609273932">[Link]</a>
							<a href="publications_pdfs/NetworkSIR_EnvSIR_repoLinks.txt">[Code Repository Information]</a>
							<br> <br>
							This is my Master's thesis, whom I was advised by Dr. Subbarayan Venkatesan at UT Dallas for.
							It provides an in-depth discussion of assumptions made by various disease modeling paradigms,
							extends the SIR model to adapt it to a distributed system (NetworkSIR), and then extends NetworkSIR
							in order to model indirect disease spread through the environment (EnvironmentalSIR). As far as I know, it is the first
							network-based model that captures environment-to-human disease spread.
							<br> <br>
							There is unfortunately some errata associated with this document: the equation on bullet point 2, page 27
							is incorrect, which has slightly thrown off some of the numbers and graphs in the results and discussion.
							The more recent paper on NetworkSIR has fixed this, and recollected all the data discussed in this thesis;
							please refer to it for more accurate results.
