								[2021] Characteristics and Outcomes of an Outpatient ID E-consult Program at

							Project focused on the outcomes and characteristics of patients who were referred for E-consults.
							ML models were also trained with patient information gathered a priori to determine if an E-consult
							would require a face to face meeting. In other words, the model was trained to determine if a face to face
							referral to a specialist would likely be required given the information known a priori about the patient.

								[2021] Outcomes of Patients Contracting COVID-19 after receiving a SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination: A Nationwide Retrospective Study 
							</p>
							<i>Sameh Saleh, Madison Pickering, Dimpy Shah, Christoph Lehmann, Richard Medford</i>.
							<a href="publications_pdfs/#">[Abstract coming soon!]</a>
							<br> <br>
							Project studied the outcomes of individuals who contracted COVID-19 after recieving one or more vaccinations,
							as opposed to individuals who did not recieve a vaccine. The major competitive advantage this study had was 
							its generalizability and large sample size&mdash;similar studies could often only work with the data available
							at a single hospital, but the data set we used was taken over millions of patients at healthcare institutions
							all over the United States.

								[2021] NetworkSIR and EnvironmentalSIR: Effective, Open-Source Epidemic Modeling in the Absence of Data
							</p>
							<i>Madison Pickering, Subbarayan Venkatesan, Christoph Lehmann, Sameh Saleh, Richard Medford</i>.
							<a href="publications_pdfs/AMIA_NetworkSIR.pdf">[Link]</a>
							<br> <br>
							This paper is essentially a summary of my Master's thesis. It has been submitted to AMIA 2021, and
							was written with a primarily medical audience in mind. (Consequently, it has none of the discussions of
							efficency that the thesis does.)

								[2020] NetworkSIR And EnvironmentalSIR: Two Simple Distributed Mechanisms For Modeling Epidemics
							</p>
							<i>Madison Pickering</i>.
							<a href="publications_pdfs/MS_Thesis__Network_SIR_Final.pdf">[Link]</a>
							<a href="publications_pdfs/NetworkSIR_EnvSIR_repoLinks.txt">[Code Repository Information]</a>
							<br> <br>
							This is my Master's thesis, whom I was advised by Dr. Subbarayan Venkatesan at UT Dallas for.
							It provides an in-depth discussion of assumptions made by various disease modeling paradigms,
							extends the SIR model to adapt it to a distributed system (NetworkSIR), and then extends NetworkSIR
							in order to model indirect disease spread through the environment (EnvironmentalSIR). As far as I know, it is the first
							network-based model that captures environment-to-human disease spread.
							<br> <br>
							There is unfortunately some errata associated with this document: the equation on bullet point 2, page 27
							is incorrect, which has slightly thrown off some of the numbers and graphs in the results and discussion.
							The more recent paper on NetworkSIR has fixed this, and recollected all the data discussed in this thesis;
							please refer to it for more accurate results.

								[2020] Tracing Malicious Transactions in a Disconnected Micro-payment System.
							</p>
							<i>Trusit Shah, Madison Pickering, Subbarayan Venkatesan, Max Irby, Lan Vu, Tung Vu</i>.
							<a href="publications_pdfs/Offline_Payment_System.pdf">[Link]</a>
							<br> <br>
							This was originally submitted to ICDCS 2020, but required revisions. (More discussion of security models.)
							Trusit Shah, who lead the project, graduated about a month before its submission and work on it sort of
							stopped and started intermittently for about a year and a half after its submission, by various people.
							As far as I know, work on this has stopped completely. However, this project (and its associated paper) is
							listed here for the sake of completeness.
